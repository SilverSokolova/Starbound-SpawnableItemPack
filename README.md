## Installation
* [Download](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-SpawnableItemPack/releases) the release for the current version of Starbound.
* Place the `SpawnableItemPack.pak` file in your mods folder (eg. `D:\Steam\steamapps\common\Starbound\mods\`). Overwrite the existing file if necessary.
* Optionally, place the `QuickbarMini.pak` in the same mods folder. This step is necessary if you don't have the mod (or StardustLib) yet.
 * This file is included in the zipped release.

## Usage

##### Opening the interface
* Open the Quickbar.
* Select 'Spawnable Item Pack' from the available options.

##### Using the interface
After opening the interface, you will be presented with a list of items. Note that the interface may take a second or two to load, as the item lists are being populated when you open the interface.

The functionality of the interface is shown in the below image.  
You can only select one category at once. Deselecting the current category is possible.

## Features
* View item information by selecting an item.
* Spawn any item in any quantity.
* Filter items by name, categories and rarities.
* Change settings such as the level of generated weapons.
* Randomize generated items before spawning them.
* Copy existing items by dragging them on the item slot.

## Things to note
* Game updates that add or remove items may cause issues, as the mod uses its own item file.
* With [OpenStarbound](https://github.com/OpenStarbound/OpenStarbound), items from all installed mods are added.
